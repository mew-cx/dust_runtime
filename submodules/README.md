# submodules

This directory contains 3rd party code.

Many subdirectories here are actual `git submodules`, but not all;
some somedirectories are captures of code from non-git websites.

I probably should have created a separate directory for the non-git stuff,
to keep this directory only for actual submodules.  Oh well.
